How to start making a crud appllication?

    Open the directory, initialize the npm and install some packatges like express, mongoose, dotenv(to keep senstive data at a place).

    1. Create two files server.js and app.js(to keep the app clean)
    2. initialize express in app.js and dotenv file
    3. export it and impor it in server.js
    4. Declare the port and listen to the sever in server.js
        const PORT = process.env.PORT || 6000;

        app.listen(PORT,()=>{
            console.log(`Server is up and running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
        })
    
    5. Now we will establish the connection with the database, for that we'll be creating a file as 'db.js' in 'db.config' folder

        a. we'll import the mongoose package and will create a method 'connectToDb' to establish the connection

        const connectToDb = async () => {
        mongoose
        .connect(process.env.MONGOURI)
        .then((conn) => {
        console.log(`Connected To DB:${conn.connection.host}`);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
        console.log(err.message);
        process.exit(1);
        });
      };

    6.and we'll simply export connectToDb and wil impor in 'app.js'

    7. Now we'll Design the schema of our database, for that we'll be creating a file 'userModels.js' in a separate folder named 'models'.

        a. import the mongoose package 
        b. creat the schema using mongoose's ' .mongoose.Schema()
            const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
            name: {
                type: String,
                required: [true, "Name is required"],
                trim: true,
                maxLength: [30, "Name should be of less than 30 characters"],
            },
            email: {
                type: String,
                unique: true,
                required: [true, "Email is mandatory"],
            },
          });

        c. Now simply export the collection using 'mongoose.model() and import it in userMethods.js coz there it's gonna be used.
            module.exports = mongoose.model("Users", userSchema);

    8. Now we'll be writing all our methods in a file 'userCotroller.js' in a separte folder 'controllers' 

        like this:
        exports.home = (req, res) => {
        res.send("<h1>Home Response</h1>");
        };

    9. Now we'll be creating another file to keep all the user routers as "userRoutes.js" in a separtef folder 'routes'    
        const express = require("express");

        const { home } = require("../controllers/userController.js");

        const router = express.Router();

        module.exports = router;

        router.get("/", home);

    10. Now to create uses in database we'll need data from front end righ, so we'll tell the app to use data coming from frontend as json or urlencoded 
        app.use(express.json())
        app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:true}))
        app.use(cors())   ---> read about it
